# DisturbedOuterMilkyWayDisc

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the figures in McMillan et al. (2022) "The disturbed outer Milky Way disc" ([Link to NASA ads](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220604059M/abstract))

Currently the figures made from N-body models aren't included. This will be fixed when I have time.
